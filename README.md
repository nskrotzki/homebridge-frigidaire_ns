# homebridge-frigidaire
homebridge Platform plugin for Frigidaire connected appliances.  This is a platform plugin for Homebridge and will auto discover each of your AC appliances.

Note that right now only AC units are supported.

## Update 6-22-2021
Code has been updated to handle Frigidaire's new app, which uses a new backend API.

			"deviceId": "O2-w1yjkjewjQt2J_AjaAaeSZZlmTQ501ahP" 
		}
	]

* ```deviceId``` - Manually set the DeviceId. Can be anything you want. Otherwise is randomly generated every time homebridge is started
